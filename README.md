<h4>OVERVIEW 
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________
The purpose of this module is to use parse existing data located in an SQL database in various tables to create new tables in order to conduct our analysis. In particular we did the following 

1) create a new table titled retirement_titles.csv. The purpose of this new table was to show all the employees who may be retiring or who have already retired 
2) Create a new table titled unique_titles.csv showing all the employees from retirement_titles.csv who have not yet retired. Then group these employees by their department to determine how many employees may be retiring from each department 
3) Create a new table titled mentorship_eligibilty.csv which determined which employees may be eligible for the mentorship program.
